## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

### Main components of the architecture
`Cooking Aids` is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following components:
* `UI`: The UI of the App.
* `Command`:The command executor.
* `Collections`: Operates on data of the App in memory.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* `Items`: Represents a collection of classes used by other components.

### How the architecture components interact with each other
The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues 
the command add -ingredient=tomato -quantity=5 -expiry=2025-04-03
