## Overview

Cooking AIDS is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that simplifies meal planning by allowing users to store, view, and organize their meals efficiently. It enables users to quickly retrieve recipes, add new ones, and plan meals across a calendar year, through intuitive commands in a terminal environment.

The application was built using Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming principles. It features a modular architecture that separates command parsing, user interface, data storage, and logic handling.
